Reaction Factory

A tool for quickly generating self-contained React Components that possess out-of-the-box styling and transitions.

The components will possess generated logic and will only need to be wired into a React app via importing them and passing them props such as button face text and a button value name.

Current component types supported:
-Buttons

Next planned component types:
-Forms

Next planned micro-changes:
-More style options

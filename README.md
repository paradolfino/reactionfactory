Reaction Factory

A tool for quickly generating SOME (Buttons and Forms) self-contained React Components that possess out-of-the-box styling and transitions.

The components will possess generated logic and will only need to be wired into a React app via importing them and passing them props such as button face text and a button value name.

Current component types supported:
-Buttons

Currently working on:
-Forms

Next planned micro-changes:
-More style options

#REACTION FACTORY TO DO

Code needs serious touch ups, but it is nearly ready to publish new features.

Need to touch up some styling also, and then need to migrate from Heroku to AWS.
